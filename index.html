<h2 id="welcome-to-my-technology-blog">Welcome to my technology blog</h2>

<p>Sometimes I take a few hours over the weekends or in the airports to try new things. I love technology and the randomness of the topics below is largely driven by my curiosity and the experiments I have done during these periods. All the code is written by me and its only purpose is learning, experimentation and fun. When analyzing data, I either use public sources or generate it myself to play with a certain algorithm.</p>

Each message contains a series of product IDs. The server maintains the map connection - subscriptions and listens to notifications on product changes from a Postgres database.

Since the launch of XGBoost, it has been the preferred way of tackling problems at machine learning competitions and not only, because of easy setup, learning speed, straightforward tuning parameters, easy to reason about results and, above all, very good results. Arguably, with current implementations, decision trees outperform many of the other machine learning techniques.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this post I will write about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a> and provide a sample implementation in C++ - or, better say, in C++ mixed with assembly language. The code is highly compiler-dependant (VC++17) and fragile, thus not production-ready. It makes assumptions about stack layout and data in registers and even something as simple as turning on optimizations will most likely crash it. But it was a fun programming exercise for a concept often implemented in asynchronous libraries or found in some programming language constructs.

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this blogpost I write about Docker. My personal Docker cheatsheet. So why Docker? Because I am interested in distributed computing and I want to play with various technologies. 
I want to be able to spin quickly complex setups and, at the same time, keep my desktop as clean as possible. The good news is that I can find all the software I need as docker containers. Even SQL Server or IIS, if I want.
Beside a huge collection of sofware already configured and the means of keeping tidy your deployments, Docker offers process isolation / sandboxing, simplified updates and ability to build your own repositories. 
This post also touches Windows Containers running on Windows Nano Server or Windows Server Core - new features available in the Docker for Windows space.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this post I touch a little bit synchronization primitives and write two different implementations for a reader-writer lock. The code comes from an earlier project, started before <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_lock</code> was introduced to the standard. 
Beside the standard library, RW locks are part of Windows SDK as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa904937(v=vs.85).aspx">Slim Reader/Writer (SRW) Locks</a> and on Linux, with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_rwlock_rdlock">pthreads</a>.
There is no need (and not recommended) to implement them manually, as I do in the code below. But since this is a tech blog and and it is meant to play around with technology, here are two possible implementations.</p>

I am going to start with the threading support introduced in the standard library, then move forward to Windows-specific code. 
I will use Windows code to exemplify how to build a minimal type-safe threading library using the new C++ 11/14, similar to the standard one.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In the previous blog post I covered a lot of ground: variadic templates, improvements to classes, improvements to standard library, smart pointers and lambdas. 
We also briefly touched move semantics as well as decltype and declval. In this part I am going to continue with move, delegated constructors, user defined literals and static_assert. In the next article 
I will write about local storage for threads while briefly touching thread support in the new standard library.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>C++ has evolved dramatically in the past years. It is virtually a new language, a huge improvement over the C++ I used to practice in the 2000s.
Much more expressive templates, richer libraries, more emphasis on compile-time safety and performance improvements. Far from the C with classes in the early 2000s and far from the convoluted template constructs which appeared later to
improve compile-time issue detection and type safety. To refresh my memory and also get up to speed with the new trends, I have spent a couple of hours digging through the docs, doing some tutorials. Here are my notes.</p>
