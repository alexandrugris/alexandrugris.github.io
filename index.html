<p>This blog is a complement to <a href="http://www.alexandrugris.ro">www.alexandrugris.ro</a> and is dedicated mostly to technology. My initial idea was to have 
a notebook where I jot down interesting stuff I read on tech, so that I have a reference point for later use. Then, I thought, hey, why not make it public? So here it is: “From The Trenches - The Code”.</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>My name is Alexandru Gris. Most of my professional life I have spent working in the videogames industry, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-GB/">Ubisoft Entertainment</a> for about 10 years. 
During my career there, I had various positions: engine developer, lead programmer, producer and, finally, studio production manager (Head Of Game Development). I love technology, I love building stuff while working with smart, creative people. 
I have a deep interest in software architecture, clean code, leadership, organization design, entrepreneurial thinking and high quality project management.</p>

<p>I currently work for <a href="https://www.1und1.de/">1and1</a>, a major European Internet company, which owns the <a href="https://web.de">Web.de</a> and <a href="https://gmx.de">GMX</a> portals.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this post I will write about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a> and provide a sample implementation in C++ - or, better say, in C++ mixed with assembly language. The code is highly compiler-dependant (VC++17) and fragile, thus not production-ready. It makes assumptions about stack layout and data in registers and even something as simple as turning on optimizations will most likely crash it. But it was a fun programming exercise for a concept often implemented in asynchronous libraries or found in some programming language constructs.

I am going to measure the cost of locking and thread contention and provide some ideas to improve performance. 
I am going to build the tests incrementally, refining the solution as I progress through the code, 
but I will also skip some steps to keep the post meaningfully short.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this blogpost I write about Docker. My personal Docker cheatsheet. So why Docker? Because I am interested in distributed computing and I want to play with various technologies. 
I want to be able to spin quickly complex setups and, at the same time, keep my desktop as clean as possible. The good news is that I can find all the software I need as docker containers. Even SQL Server or IIS, if I want.
Beside a huge collection of sofware already configured and the means of keeping tidy your deployments, Docker offers process isolation / sandboxing, simplified updates and ability to build your own repositories. 
This post also touches Windows Containers running on Windows Nano Server or Windows Server Core - new features available in the Docker for Windows space.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this post I touch a little bit synchronization primitives and write two different implementations for a reader-writer lock. The code comes from an earlier project, started before <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_lock</code> was introduced to the standard. 
Beside the standard library, RW locks are part of Windows SDK as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa904937(v=vs.85).aspx">Slim Reader/Writer (SRW) Locks</a> and on Linux, with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_rwlock_rdlock">pthreads</a>.
There is no need (and not recommended) to implement them manually, as I do in the code below. But since this is a tech blog and and it is meant to play around with technology, here are two possible implementations.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In this post I am planning to build upon C++ 11/14 features introduced in the previous posts and play around with threads and synchronization. 
I am going to start with the threading support introduced in the standard library, then move forward to Windows-specific code. 
I will use Windows code to exemplify how to build a minimal type-safe threading library using the new C++ 11/14, similar to the standard one.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>In the previous blog post I covered a lot of ground: variadic templates, improvements to classes, improvements to standard library, smart pointers and lambdas. 
We also briefly touched move semantics as well as decltype and declval. In this part I am going to continue with move, delegated constructors, user defined literals and static_assert. In the next article 
I will write about local storage for threads while briefly touching thread support in the new standard library.</p>

        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>C++ has evolved dramatically in the past years. It is virtually a new language, a huge improvement over the C++ I used to practice in the 2000s.
Much more expressive templates, richer libraries, more emphasis on compile-time safety and performance improvements. Far from the C with classes in the early 2000s and far from the convoluted template constructs which appeared later to
improve compile-time issue detection and type safety. To refresh my memory and also get up to speed with the new trends, I have spent a couple of hours digging through the docs, doing some tutorials. Here are my notes.</p>
